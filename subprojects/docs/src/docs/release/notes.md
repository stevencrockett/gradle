## Upgrade Instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 6.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_6.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@. 

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. --> 

## Features for Gradle tooling providers

### `TestLauncher` can select specific methods

The `TestLauncher` interface in the Tooling API is capable of launching tests by specifying the name of the test classes or methods. If there are multiple test tasks contain those test classes/methods, then all tasks are executed. This is not ideal for IDEs: developers usually want to execute only one test variant at the time. To overcome this, Gradle 6.1 introduces the `withTaskAndTestClasses()` and `withTaskAndTestMethods()` methods.

## Improvements for plugin authors

### New managed property types

TBD - Managed properties of type `DomainObjectSet<T>` now supported.

### New factory methods

TBD - `ObjectFactory` has a method to create `ExtensiblePolymorphicDomainObjectContainer` instances.
TBD - `ObjectFactory` has a method to create `NamedDomainObjectSet` instances.
TBD - `ObjectFactory` has a method to create `NamedDomainObjectList` instances.

## Promoted features
Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User Manual section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

### Gradle Dependency Cache can be relocated

With this release, the Gradle Dependency cache, that is the content under `$GRADLE_HOME/caches/modules-2`, can be relocated, for data cached by Gradle version 6.1 and later.
This enables its copy from host to host, allowing to fully leverage all the cached information: artifacts downloaded and metadata parsed.

Note that priming the cache and consuming it needs to use the same Gradle version for maximum effect.
See [the documentation](userguide/dependency_resolution.html#sub:cache_copy) for details on this.

This is one step in helping out ephemeral CI setups where host images can be seeded with dependency cache content, reducing the amout of downloads during the build.
